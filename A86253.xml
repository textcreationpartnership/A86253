            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Leaſe to two, <hi>habendum</hi> to one for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the other for life, this limitation doth alter the generall implication of the joyntenancy which would have been without the <hi>habendum,</hi> and therefore the <hi>habendum</hi> voide, in that the Premiſes doth make them joynttenants, &amp; the <hi>habendum</hi> would ſever the joynter, and make the one to have the whole during his life, and the other the whole after him, <hi>Plowden fo.</hi> 133. <hi>vide</hi> Sir <hi>Ed.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">But note that where a remainder is once well raiſed by the Livery and Seiſin, though the perticular eſtate be afterwards avoided by condition in Law, as by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in waſt, or if a Feme Tenant for life diſagree to the Livery after the death of her husband <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet he to whom the remainder is limited ſhall be Tenant in taile in remainder, <hi>vi. 1. part.

            <p>As if the leſſor confirme the eſtate of his Leſſee for yeares, the remainder in Fee, this remainder is void, becauſe the eſtate for yeares was made before the remainder, and not at the time of the remainder.</p>
            <p>If the leſſor diſſeiſe his Tenant for life, and then makes a new Leaſe to him for life, the remainder in in Fee, that remainder is void, becauſe the Tenant for life is remitted to the eſtate which was made long time before the remainder appointed, ſo the eſtate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent was not made at the ſame time of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and therefore the remainder void.</p>
            <p>So if the heire endow his mother, the remainder in Fee, this remainder is void though Livery and Seſin be made to the mother, becauſe the dowre hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the death of her husband, and ſo for that the eſtate precedent was not made when the remainder was appointed, the remainder is voide.</p>

            <p>As if one make a Leaſe for life, and that a day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of Tenant for life it ſhall remaine over, this remainder is void, becauſe the firſt eſtate is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before the appointment of the remainder.</p>
            <p>So if one make a Leeſe for life upon condition, that if he doth not ſuch an Act, that his eſtate ſhall ceaſe, and that then it remain over in Fee, this remainder is void, becauſe it doth not veſt during the eſtate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>
            <p>The remainder muſt be out of the leſſor, executed or executory at the time of the Livery and ſeaſin made, and at the time of the poſſeſſion taken by the perticular Tenant.</p>
            <p>If a man hath iſſue a Son of nine yeares, and makes a Leaſe till his ſon ſhall come to his full age, &amp; then the remainder to another in Fee, nothing veſteth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to him in remainder, and the remainder is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void, and yet it may take effect, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

            <p>Leaſe for yeares, the remainder over in Fee, if the tenant enter before livery, his terme is good, but the remainder is void, becauſe the remainder was not out of the leſſor at the time of the poſſeſſion taken by the particular tenant, but if I appoint the Leaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence at Michaelmas next, the remainder over in Fee, there although the leſſor make Livery to the Leſſee, yet the Livery and Seiſin and the remainder ſhall be void; becauſe there was no eſtate preſent, whereunto the Livery may be annexed, and whereunto it might u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in the meane time.</p>
            <p>HEE to whom the remainder is appointed, muſt at that very time be a perſon able and of capacity to take the remainder, or elſe the remainder ſhall be void; and it is a principle in Law, that in all gifts, be they by deviſe, or otherwiſe, it behooveth to have a Donee in <hi>eſſe,</hi> which hath power and capacity to take the thing given, at the very time when it ought to veſt, for if there be not any ſuch in <hi>rerum natura</hi> when the thing ought to veſt,<note place="margin">There is a diverſity between a remainder limited by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar name, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by a general name, may be good, though the perſon be not in <hi>eſſe</hi> at the time of the remainder limited, as in this caſe next following.

            <p>If a Leaſe be made to two, the remainder over in Fee, after the death of the firſt of them, this remainder is voide, becauſe the Servivor ſhall hold place after the death of the firſt, and therefore repugnant and void.</p>
            <p>If a Leaſe be made for life, the remainder for life, and if the firſt tenant for life dy, then the remainder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to a ſtranger over in Fee, this remainder depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on a repugnancy precedent, and therefore voide.</p>
            <p>If a Leaſe be made for yeares rendant rent, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of none payment; the remainder to a ſtranger, and Livery is made accordingly, that is a void remainder which doth commence upon a repugnancy precedent, and which dependeth upon a condition which goeth to the deſtruction of the perticular eſtate, and eſpecially where ſuch a remainder is created by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſeſin.</p>
            <p>But by a limitation of a deviſe, or by limitation of uſe, ſuch remainder is good, as a Feoffment to the uſe of <hi>I.

            <p>If a man deviſe his Lands to his wife for her life, upon condition that if ſhe marrie, that then the Land ſhall remaine to F.

            <p>As if a Leaſe be made for life upon condition, that if the Leſſee die, the remainder to a ſtranger, that is a good remainder, becauſe it commenceth upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of an eſtate which is certaine and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine; for every man muſt die, and every terme muſt end, and therefore it is no condition but a limitation, or appointment when the terme ſhall commence.</p>
            <p>If I make a Leaſe for life upon condition, that if the Leſſee doth ſuch an act, he ſhall have fee, and he doth it accordingly, there he ſhall have Fee, becauſe he is privie to the condition, and therefore ſhall take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof.</p>
            <p>A Leaſe made for yeares (if the Leſſee ſhall ſo long live) which is a word conditionall, and doth precede the remainder, therefore the remainder which doth commence upon a condition is voide, <hi>Plowden fo.</hi> 25.</p>

            <p>Leſſee for life, the remainder to A his wife for her life (if ſhe live ſo long ſole and unmarried) the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to D. their Son for his life, the remainder to D. is good, though it commence upon a condition, becauſe the particular eſtate continueth, and the condition goeth not to the deſtruction of the particular eſtate, and the firſt remainder doth veſt during the particular eſtate, which maketh the latter to be good, though it commence upon the condition.

            <p>By the Feoffment of tenent for life, the remainder is deſtroyed, for by the Feofment of <hi>Ro.</hi> his eſtate for life was determined by condition in law therunto annexed, and that may not be revived, afterwards by any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, &amp; therfore the contingent remainder deſtroyed.</p>

               <p>If a man do leaſe or aſſure his land to another, and all the Mynes and Pits thein, for life or yeares, the leſſee may open and dig the ground for Coale, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and take and carry away the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were not any Myne open at the time of the leaſe, for by this aſſurance it appeareth that the leſſor was contented that waſte ſhould be made in any part of the ground leaſed by myning or digging.

But though the houſe be ruinous at the Tenants income, yet if he pull it downe it is Waſte, unleſſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifie it againe; if Glaſſe-Windowes (though glazed by the Tenant himſelfe) be broken downe or carried away, it is Waſte, for the Glaſſe is part of the houſe. And ſo it is of Wainſcot, Benches, Doores, Windowes, Furnaces and the like, annexed or fixed to the houſe, either by him in Reverſion, or the Tenant.</p>
               <p>Though there be no Timber growing upon the ground, yet the Tenant at his perill muſt keep the houſe from waſting.</p>
               <p>If the Tenant do Waſte or ſuffer Waſte to be done in houſes, yet if he repaire them before an Action brought, there lyeth no Action of Waſte againſt him,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120111:30"/> but he cannot plead <hi>Quod non fecit vaſtum,</hi> but the ſpeciall matter.</p>

               <p>Lopping of Trees by a Copyholder is not a forfeiture, but a Copyholder may not lop and burne them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſe of the Land or Mannor, nor ſell the Lops unleſſe by the Cuſtome he may do waſte <hi>Kitchin forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> 125.</p>

               <p>The Tenant may take ſufficient wood to repaire the Walls, Pales, Fences, Hedges, and Ditches as he found them, but he can take no new, and he may alſo take ſufficient Plow-bote, Fire-bote, and other Houſe-bote.</p>
               <p>The Tenant cutteth downe Trees for reparations, and ſelleth them, and after buyeth them againe, and imployes them about neceſſary reparations, yet it is waſte for the Sale, he cannot ſell Trees, and with the money cover the houſe, burning of the houſe by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or miſchances waſte.</p>

               <p>In many caſes a Tenant for life or years may fell down timber to make reparations, albeit he be not compellable thereunto, and ſhall not be puniſhed for the ſame in any action of waſte: As if a houſe be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous at the time of the Leaſe made, if the Leſſee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the houſe to fall down, he is not puniſhable, for he is not bound by the Law to repaire the houſe in that caſe; and yet if he cut down Timber upon the ground ſo letten, and repaire it, he may well juſtifie it, the reaſon is for that the Law doth favour the ſupportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and maintenance of houſes of habitation for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>If the Leſſor by his Covenant undertake to repaire the houſes, yet the Leſſee (if the Leſſor doth it not) may with the timber growing upon the ground repaire it, though he be not compellable thereunto.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Leaſe muſt be made by Deed indented.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt be made to begin from the day of the making, or from the making thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there be an old Leaſe in being it muſt be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, or expired, or ended within a year of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Leaſe, and the ſurrender muſt be abſolute, and not conditionall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There muſt not be a double Leaſe in being at one time; As if a Leaſe for years be made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Statute, he in the Reverſion cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the Leſſee, and make a Leaſe for life or lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute, nor <hi>e converſo,</hi> for the words of the Statute be to make a Leaſe for three lives, or one and twenty yeares, ſo as the one or the other may be made, and not both.</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:120111:37"/>5. It muſt not exceed three lives, or one and twenty yeares from the making of it, but it may be for a Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer terme, or fewer lives.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It muſt be of Lands, Tenements, or Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments maynorable, or corporeall, which are neceſſary to be letten, and whereunto a Rent by Law may be reſerved, and not of things that lye in Grant, as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſons, Faires, Markets, Franchiſes, and the like, out whereof a Rent cannot be reſerved.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It muſt be of Lands or Tenements which have been moſt commonly letten by the ſpace of twenty years next before the Leaſe made, ſo as if it be letten for eleven yeares at one, or ſeverall times within thoſe twenty yeares, it is ſufficient. A Grant by Copy of Court Roll in fee, for life or yeares, is a good letting to farme within this Statute, for he is but Tenant at will, <hi>Secund. Conſ. Manerii:</hi> And ſo it is of a Leaſe at will by the Common Law; But thoſe lettings to Farme muſt be made by ſome ſeiſed of an Eſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and not by a Guardian in Chivalry, Tenant by Gurteſie, Tenant in Dower, or the like.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That upon every ſuch Leaſe there be reſerved yearely during the ſaid Leaſe due and payable to the Leſſors, their Heirs and Succeſſors <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo much yearly Farme or Rent as hath been moſt accuſtomably yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and paid for the Land within twenty yeares before ſuch Leaſe made.</p>
               <p>Hereby firſt it appeareth that nothing can be demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by authority of this Act, but that whereon a Rent may be lawfully reſerved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that where not only a yearly Rent was formerly reſerved, but things not annuall, as Herriots, or any Fine, or other profit, at or upon the death of the farmor, yet if the yearly rent be reſerved upon a Leaſe made by force of this Statute, it ſufficeth by the expreſſe words of the Act: And if twenty acres of land have been accuſtomably letten, and a Leaſe is made of theſe twenty, and one acre which was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomably letten, reſerving the cuſtomably yearely rent, and ſo much more as exceeds the value of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120111:38"/> acre, this Leaſe is not warrantably letten, and the rent iſſueth out of the whole.</p>
               <p>If Tenant in taile let part of the land accuſtomably letten, and reſerve a rent <hi>pro rat,</hi> or more, this is good, for that is in ſubſtance the accuſtomable Rent.</p>
               <p>If two Coparceners be Tenant in taile of 20. acres, every one of equall value, and uſually letten, and they make partition, ſo as each have ten acres, they may make Leaſes of their ſeverall parts, each of them reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the halfe of the accuſtomable rent.</p>
               <p>If the uſuall Rent had been payable at foure dayes or Feaſts of the yeare, yet if it be reſerved yearly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at one Feaſt, it is ſufficient, for the words of the Statute be [reſerved yearely.]</p>
               <p>Ninthly, nor to any Leaſe to be made without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Waſte, therefore if a Leaſe be made for life, the Remainder for life <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is not War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Statute becauſe it is diſpuniſhable for VVaſte, but if a Leaſe be made to one during three lives, this is good for the Occupant, if any happen, ſhall be puniſhed for VVaſte, the words of the Statute be, <hi>ſeiſed in the right of his Church,</hi> yet if a Biſhop that is ſeiſed in <hi>jure Epiſcopatus:</hi> A Deane of his ſole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in <hi>jure Decanatus;</hi> An Arch-deacon in <hi>jure Archidiaconatus.</hi> A Prebendary and the life are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute, for every of them is generally ſeiſed in <hi>jure Eccleſiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Grants, Feoffments, Leaſes, and other Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances or Eſtates to any Maſter, or Fellowes of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Deane and Chapiter, Maſter, or Guardian of an Hoſpitall, Parſon, Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> other then for one and twenty yeares, or three lives, from the time of ſuch Leaſe or Grant, reſerving the accuſtomable yearely rent yearly payable, ſhall be meerly void. 18 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. cap.</hi> 11. All Leaſes made by ſuch perſons (as 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 10. before) where another Leaſe for yeares is in being, not to be expired, ſurrendred, or ended within three years next after the making of ſuch new Leaſe, ſhall be void: All Bonds, and Covenants for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:120111:38"/> renewing or making of any Leaſe contrary hereunto, or to 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 10. before, ſhall be void.</p>
               <p>But a Parſon and Vicar are excepted out of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and therefore if either of them make a Leaſe for three lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of lands uſually letten, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the uſuall rent, it muſt be alſo confirmed by the Patron and Ordinary, becauſe it is excepted out of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and not reſtrained by the Statute of 1. or 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and what hath been ſaid concerning a Leaſe for three lives doth hold for a Leaſe of one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeak ſomewhat of the diſabling Statutes of 1. and 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the words of the exception out of the reſtraint and diſability of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are,<note place="margin">Notes of things well and duty to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> other then for the terme of one and twenty years, or three lives, from ſuch time as any Grant or aſſurance ſhall be given, whereupon the old and accuſtomed yearely rent or more ſhall be reſerved. And to that effect is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Firſt, it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that neither of theſe nor any other do in any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſort alter or change the enabling Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, it is to bee knowne that no leaſe made according to exceptation of 1 <hi>Eliz,</hi> and 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and not warranted by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. if it be made by a Biſhop, or any ſole Corporation, but it muſt be confirmed by the Deanes and Chapiters, or others that have intereſt, as hath been ſaid in the caſe of the Parſon and Vicar, but examples do illuſtrate. If a Biſhop make a Leaſe for one and twenty yeares, and all theſe yeares being ſpent, ſaving three, or more, yet may the Biſhop make a new Leaſe to another for one and twenty yeares, to begin from the making, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exception of the Statute, but not a Leaſe for life or lives as hath been ſaid: But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Leaſe hath been reſolved to be good as well upon the exception of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the caſe of Biſhops as upon 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which extend to Spirituall and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:120111:39"/> Corporations aggregate of many, as Deanes and Chapiters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the Leaſes for years to be made according to the exceptions of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 1. and 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> muſt begin from the making and not from the day of the making, but by force of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. from the day of the making: And though the Statutes of 1. and 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> do not appoint the Leaſe to be made by writing, yet muſt it therein and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 8. properties or qualities before mentioned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. follow the patterne thereof, the concurrent Leaſe onely excepted. And though the exception in 1. and 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> concerning the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rent is more generall then that of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and there is not any proviſion made for Leaſes made diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhable of waſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet muſt the patterne of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. be followed for Leaſes made without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of waſte by ſuch Spirituall and Eccleſiaſticall perſons, are unreaſonable, and are cauſes of diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And albeit it be proved by the ſaid Acts, that all Grants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> other then Leaſes for three lives, or one and twenty yeares, according to theſe Acts, ſhould be utterly void and of none effect to all intents. Yet Grants or Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor warranted by theſe Acts, are not void but good againſt the Leſſor, (if it be a ſole Corporation) or ſo long as the Deane or other head of the Corporation remaine, if it be a Corporation aggregate of many, for the Statute was made in benefit of the Succeſſor, 3. <hi>pars.

               <p>Thirdly, it muſt be made to her ſelfe, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it muſt be made in ſatisfaction of her whole Dower, and not in part of her Dower.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it muſt either be expreſſed or averred to be in ſatisfaction of her Dower.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it may be made either before or after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, if a man make a Feoffment in fee of Lands or Tenements either before or after marriage, to the uſe of the husband for life, and after to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> for life, and then to the uſe of the wife for life in ſatisfaction of her Dower, this is no Joynture within the Statute, becauſe by the firſt limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it was not to take effect in poſſeſſions or profit preſently after the death of her husband; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that caſe <hi>A.</hi> ſhould dye, living the husband, and after the death of the husband the wife entreth, yet this is no Bar of Dower, but ſhe ſhal have her Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alſo, becauſe it is not within the ſaid Statute, and by the Common Law it was no Bar of Dower.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it muſt be either in Fee-taile, or for terme of her owne life, for an Eſtate for life or lives, of one or many others, or to her for a hundred yeares (if ſhe live ſo long) or without ſuch limitation is no Bar of Dower, albeit it be made expreſly in ſatisfaction of her Dower.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if an Eſtate be made to others in Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or for life upon truſt, ſo as the Eſtate remaine in them, albeit it be for her benefit, and by her aſſent, and by expreſſe words to be in full ſatisfaction of her Dower, yet is this no Bar of her Dower.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Surrender in Law.</note>A Surrender in Law is in ſome caſes of greater force then a Surrender in Deed, as if a man make a Leaſe for yeares to begin at <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> next, this future intereſt cannot be ſurrendred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no reverſion wherein it may be drown- But by a Surrender in Law it may be drowned: As if the Leſſee before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> take a new Leaſe for yeares, either to begin preſently, or at a day to come, this is a Surrender in Law of the former Leaſe.</p>
               <p>Leſſee for yeares grants a Rent-charge, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet the Rent ſhall be paid during the yeares. So
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:120111:40"/> if he in Reverſion grant a Rent-charge during the terme, and then the Leſſee doth ſurrender unto him, he ſhall pay the Rent during the terme, for a ſtranger that is a Grantee of the Rent ſhall ſay for his benefit that the terme continueth, and that it is not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>If a man make a Leaſe for forty yeares,<note place="margin">Surrender by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a new Leaſe.

But if it be not preſented at the next court accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome, then the ſurrender becometh void, and ſo it was clearly holden, <hi>Paſch. 14 Eliz.</hi> in the court of common Pleas.</note> the Leſſee afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> taketh a Leaſe for twenty years, upon condition, that if he doth ſuch an act, then the Leaſe for twenty yeares ſhall be void, and after the Leſſee breakes the Condition by force, whereof the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leaſe is void, yet the Leaſe for forty yeares is ſurrendred, for the Condition was annexed to the Leaſe for twenty yeares, but the Surrender was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. So if a man make a Leaſe for forty years, and the Leſſor grants the Reverſion to the Leſſee upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and after the Condition is broken, the terme was absolutely ſurrendred. And the diverſity is when the Leſſor grants the Reverſion, and when the Leſſee grants or ſurrenders his Eſtates to the Leſſor, for a Condition to a Surrender may reveſt the particular Eſtate, becauſe the Surrender is conditionall. But when the Leſſor grants the Reverſion to the Leſſee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition, there the Condition is annexed to the Reverſion, and the Surrender abſolute.</p>
               <p>If Leſſee for yeares accept a new Leaſe of his Leſſor to begin preſently or at a day to come, that is a preſent ſurrender of the firſt Leaſe.</p>
               <p>And if Leſſee for forty yeares take a new Leaſe to him and his Son by Deed indented for twenty yeares, by which. Deed the Leſſor covenanteth , that if the Son dye within the terme, that then the firſt Leaſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:120111:41"/> ſhall ſtand in his force, the ſame Leaſe, or any other thing notwithſtanding, although the Son dye within the ſaid twenty yeares, yet this Covenant ſhall not revive the firſt Leaſe.</p>
               <p>And if a Leaſe be made for twenty yeares, to begin at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and after before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee excepteth a new Leaſe of his Leſſor, of the ſame land by Deed indented for ſixteen yeares, the Leſſee upon his entry at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> is but Termor for ſixteen yeares, and that is by reaſon of the Deed indented, and the agreement which amounteth to a Grant of the firſt Leaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for an intereſt of a terme may not be ſurrendred before that it be in poſſeſſion, nor the Leſſee ſhall not have <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> nor Action of Treſpaſſe before he be in poſſeſſion: But he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit or grant ſuch intereſt of a terme, yet ſome hold that ſuch intereſt may by acceptance of a new Leaſe be ſurrendred very well. And they take a diverſity where the ſecond Leaſe may determine before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt, then the acceptance of that is no Surrender, otherwiſe it is if it containe a day after the beginning of the other, then they ſay that it is a Surrender.</p>
               <p>But it is a Principle that it behoveth that he that ſurrendreth be ſeiſed or poſſeſſed of the Eſtate and of the thing ſurrendred at the time of the ſurrender made, for a ſurrender made by Tenant for life diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed is void, for that he hath but a right at the time of the ſurrender, the ſame Law of a ſurrender made by a Fome which hath title to Dower, is void. Alſo a man may not ſurrender a right to a terme, and a man may not ſurrender that which he hath not as a terme, which is to begin at a day to come, nor a terme before that the Leſſor which ſurrenders hath entred lawfully by force of his Leaſe, for a Releaſe made to ſuch Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee by the Leſſor before the beginning, and before the poſſeſſion had of his Leaſe is void. Alſo the Leſſor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth poſſeſſed of the Demeſne, and hath not any reverſion before that.</p>
               <p>And in every ſurrender theſe foure things are to be

               <p>Thoſe Executors may meddle with the goods and diſpoſe them before they prove the Will, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring an Action for any debt or duty, before they have proved the Will.</p>
               <p>The proving of the Will is thus, they are to exhibit the Will into the Bishops Court, and then they are to be ſworne, and the Bishops Officers are to keep the Will Originall, and certifie the Copy thereof in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the Bishops ſcale of Office, which Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo ſealed is called the Will proved.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is now altered by the Statute Law, ſo as the Bishops are to grant Letters of Adminiſtration of the goods at this day to the Wife, if she require it, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or next of kin, if they refuſe it (as often they doe) becauſe the debts are greater then the eſtate will beare, then ſome Creditors or ſome other will take it, as the Bishops Officers shall think meet. It groweth often in queſtion what Bishop shall have the right of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:120111:47"/> proving Wills, and granting Adminiſtration of Goods.</p>
               <p>In which Controverſie the rule is thus, That if the party dead, had at the time of his death <hi>Bona notabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> in divers Dioceſſes of ſome reaſonable value, the Arch-biſhop of the Province where he died is to have the approbation of his Will, and grant the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Goods, as the caſe falleth out, otherwiſe the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe is to do it.</p>
               <p>If there be but one Executor made, yet he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Executorſhip coming before the Biſhop, ſo that he hath not intermeddled with any of the Goods before, or with receiving Debts or paying Legacies.</p>
               <p>And if there be more Executors then one, ſo many as liſt may refuſe, and if any one take it upon him, the reſt that did once refuſe may when they will take it upon them, &amp; no executor ſhal be further charged with Debts or legacies, then the value of the goods come to his hands. So that he foreſee that he pay Debts upon Record, Debts to the King. Then upon Judgments, Statutes, Recognizances, then Debts by Bond and Bill ſealed, Rent unpaid, Servants Wages, payment to head-workmen; and laſtly Shop-books, and Contracts by word, for if an Executor or Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pay Debts to others before to the King, or Debts due by Bond before thoſe due by Record, or Debts by Shop-book, and Contracts before thoſe by Bond, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of rent, and Servants Wages, he ſhall pay the ſame over againe to theſe others in the ſaid degrees.</p>
               <p>But yet the law giveth them choice, that where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have debts due in equall degree of record or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he may pay which of them he will before any Suit be brought againſt him, but if Suit be brought he muſt firſt pay them that get Judgment againſt him.</p>
               <p>Any one Executor may convey the Goods, or releaſe Debts without his Companion, and any one by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe may do as much as all together: But one mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing of Debts, or ſelling of Goods ſhall not charge the other to pay ſo much of the Goods, if there be not enough to pay debts, but it ſhall charge the party himſelf that did ſo releaſe or convey.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:120111:48"/>
               <p>But it is not ſo with Adminiſtrators, for they have but one Authority given them by the Biſhop over the Goods, which Authority being given to many, is to be executed by all of them joyned together.</p>
               <p>And if an Executor dye making an Executor, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Executor is Executor to the firſt Teſtator.</p>
               <p>But if an Adminiſtrator die inteſtate, then his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator ſhall not be Executor to the firſt: But in that caſe the Biſhop whom we call the Ordinarie is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Adminiſtration of the firſt Teſtators Goods to his Wife, or next of kin, as if he had died inteſtate; Alwaies provided, that that which the Executor did in his life time is to be allowed for good. And ſo if an Adminiſtrator die and make his Executor, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Adminiſtrator ſhall not be Executor to the firſt Inteſtate, but the Ordinarie muſt new commit the Adminiſtration of the Goods of the firſt Inteſtate.</p>
               <p>Again, if the Exetutor or Adminiſtrator pay Debts or Funeralls, or Legacies of his owne money, he may retaine ſo much of the Goods in kind of the Teſtator or Inteſtate, and ſhall have property of it in kind.</p>

               <p>But if there be Father and Son, and the Father hath a brother that is Uncle to the Son, and the Son pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe lands in fee, and die without iſſue, living the Father, the Uncle ſhall have the lands as heire to the Son, and not the Father, yet the Father is neerer of blood; becauſe it is a Maxime in Law, that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may lineally deſcend, but not aſcend, yet if the Son in this caſe die without iſſue, and the Uncle enter into the land as heire to the Son, and after the Uncle dieth without iſſue (living the Father) the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall have the land as heire to the Uncle, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:120111:68"/> not as heire to his Son, for that he cometh to the land by collaterall diſcent, and not by lineall aſcent, and his Uncle enter into the land: for if the Uncle in this caſe doth not enter into the land, then cannot the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inherit the land; for there is another Maxime in Law herein implied, That a man that claimeth as heir in Fee-ſimple to any man by diſcent, muſt make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf heire to him that was laſt ſeiſed of the actual Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and inheritance. And if the Uncle in this caſe doth not enter, then had he but a Freehold in Law, and no actuall Freehold, but the laſt that was ſeiſed of the actuall Freehold, was the Son to whom the Father cannot make himſelf heire. And therefore <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, And his Uncle enter into the land (as he ought) by the Law to make the Father to inherit as heire to the Uncle.</p>
               <p>Note, that true it is, that the Uncle in this caſe is heire but not abſolutely heire, for if after the diſcent to him the Father hath iſſue a Son or a Daughter, that iſſue ſhall enter upon the Uncle. And ſo it is if a man hath iſſue a Son and a Daughter, the Son purchaſeth land in fee, and dieth without iſſue, the Daughter ſhall inherit the land, but if the Father hath afterward iſſue a Son, this Son ſhall enter into the land as heire to his brother, and if he hath iſſue a Daughter and no Son, ſhe ſhall be Co-partner with her Siſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As he ought by the Law.</hi> Theſe words as a Key do open the ſecrets of the Law; for hereupon it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that where the Uncle cannot get an actuall poſſeſſion, by entry or otherwiſe there the Father in this caſe cannot inherit. And therefore if an Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be granted to the Son and his Heires, and the Son die, and this diſcend to the Uncle, and he die before he doth or can preſent to the Church, the Father ſhall not inherit, becauſe he ſhould make himſelf heire to the Son, which he cannot do. And ſo of a rent and the like: But if the Uncle had preſented to the Church, or had Seiſin of the rent, there the Father ſhould have inherited. For <hi>Littleton</hi> putteth his caſe of an entry
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:120111:68"/> into land: But for an example, if the Son make a Leaſe for life and die without iſſue, and the Reverſion diſcend to the Uncle, and he die, the Reverſion ſhall not diſcend to the Father, becauſe in that caſe he muſt make himſelf heire to the Son.</p>
               <p>If the Father make a Leaſe for years, and the Leſſee entreth, and the Father dieth, the eldeſt Son dieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entry, or receipt of the rent, the younger Son of the half blood ſhall not inherit, but the Siſter, becauſe the poſſeſſion of the Leſſee for years is the poſſeſſion of the eldeſt Son, ſo as he is actually ſeiſed of the Frank-tenement and the Inheritance, and conſequently the Siſter of the whole blood is to be heire. And ſo if lands be holden by Knights ſervice, and the eldeſt Son is within age, and the Guardian entreth into the lands. An ſo likewiſe if Guardian in Socage enters.</p>
               <p>But in the caſe aforeſaid, if the Father make a leaſe for life, or a gift in tail, and dieth, and the eldeſt Son dieth in the life of Tenant for life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the younger brother of the half blood ſhall inherit, becauſe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life or Tenant in tail is ſeiſed of the Freehold, and the eldeſt Son had nothing but a Reverſion expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant upon the Freehold, and therefore the youngeſt Son ſhall inherit the land as Heire to his Father, who was laſt ſeiſed of the actuall Freehold. And albeit a rent had been reſerved on the eſtate for life, and the eldeſt Son had received the rent, and died, yet it is holden by that the younger brother ſhall inherit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeiſin of the rent is no actuall ſeiſin of the Freehold of the land: but <hi>Liber Aſſ. part.</hi> 2. ſeemeth to the contrary. <hi>Ideo quaere.</hi>

               <p>IN the buyng and ſelling of Land or Houſes we ought, as well, to conſider the value of that which is bought or ſold, as the manner of conveyance: now the intereſt of money being the generall ground to vallue the purchaſe by; we will here annex ſuch propoſitions thereof, as are convenient to be knowne by the buyer and the ſeller both.</p>
               <p>And the propoſitions or queſtions concerning mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as have reference to the increaſe, or to the rebate thereof.</p>
               <p>The increaſe or intereſt of money is either ſimple or compound.</p>
               <p>Simple intereſt, is that which ariſeth or is compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the increaſe of the principall onely, as if a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:120111:105"/> 100 l. be forborne two yeares, the ſimple intereſt thereof after the rate of 6. pounds for 100. pounds for 1. yeare, will be 12. pound, <hi>viz.</hi> 6. pound due at the firſt yeares end, and 6. pounds due at the ſecond yeares end.</p>
               <p>Now the queſtions of ſimple intereſt being in our uſuall Tables performed by addition onely, doe ſeeme very eaſie, but many times there are ſo many ſummes to be added together, that it proves very tedious in the opperation, and multiplication which is nothing but a ſpeedy addition in numbers of ſeverall denominations will I am ſure to the generallity of men be much more difficult; but the difficulty hereof may be avoided, by the table, entituled of a Table reduction of money into Decimalls, and the contrary; for illuſtration ſake we will adde an examle in each.</p>

               <p>REbate or diſcount of money is, when a ſum of money due at any time to come is ſatisfied by the payment of ſo much preſent money, which being put forth at a certain rate of intereſt for the ſaid time, would become equal to the ſum firſt due: and thus if 50. pound not due till two years hence, to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the payment of preſent money upon rebate, after the rate of 6. pound <hi>per cent. per annum,</hi> ſimple intereſt, there ought to be ſo much ready money paid, which in two years time after the ſaid rate of intereſt would be augmented unto 50. pounds: and to finde what that ſum is, uſe this analogy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the ſum propounded with the intereſt thereof</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To its worth in ready money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the ſimple intereſt of 50. pound for 2. years is 6. pound, I ſay therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As</hi> 56. <hi>pound to</hi> 50. <hi>pound, ſo is</hi> 50. <hi>pound to its worth in ready money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore to anſwer this queſtion, I multiply 50. pound by 50. pound, and the product is 2500. l. which being divided by 56. the quotient will be 44. 64285. that is 44. pound, 12. shill. 10. pence, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

As if 100. pound be forborn three years, and compound intereſt thereof is to be computed at the rate of 6. <hi>per cent. per annum,</hi> there will ariſe beſides the ſimple intereſt of the principal for three years, the intereſt of 6. pound due at the years end for 2. years, and the intereſt of 6. pound due at 2. years end, for 1. year, to compute this for any number of years under 31. at the rates of 6, 7, or 8. <hi>per cent.</hi> uſe this analogy.</p>
